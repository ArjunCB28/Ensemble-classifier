# Ensemble-classifier

This porject is about creating an ensemble deep neural network classifier that uses aut-encoders for feature selection. A detailed comparison is done between the regular classifiers (feature selection is done using LDA) and the deep neural classifiers. The primary objective is to evaluate the performance difference between regular classification models with topic modeling and deep neural network with auto-encoders.
Tools/technologies used: Scikit-learn, Python machine learning models, Keras
